# --- PROGRAM CALCULATES THE REMAINDER USING DOUBLE SUBTRACTION ---
# Translated from the following pseudocode:

# function doubleSubtractionRemainder(dividened, divisor):
#     remainder = dividened
# 
#     while remainder >= divisor:
#         multiple = divisor
#

#         while multiple * 2 <= remainder:
#             multiple = multiple * 2
# 
#         # Subtract the largest multiple from the remainder
#         remainder = remainder - multiple

#     return remainder
