# Babbage Lite

**Babbage Lite** is an **Analytical Engine** emulator based on a _certain professor's_ simplified lesson on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine at _a certain university_. It is inspired by John Walker's [Analytical Engine Emulator](https://fourmilab.ch/babbage/emulator.html).

This emulator aims to provide a simplified yet functional approach to understanding Babbage's design and its basic principles.

## Key Differences Between the Original Model & the Simplified Model

Below are some key differences between the original machine and the _certain professor's_ simplified model:

|                           | **Original Analytical Engine**                                                         | **Simplified Analytical Engine**                            |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Number Representation** | Has a decimal-based gear system where each gear represented a digit (0-9).             | Will handle real numbers of any size.                       |
| **Registers & Memory**    | Includes 2 primed ingress axes and 1 primed egress axis for complex data manipulation. | Does not require primed ingress axes or primed egress axes. |
